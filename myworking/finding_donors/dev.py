#2.Prepare the Data - Preprocessing
"""
Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, 
it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured â€” this is typically known as preprocessing. 
Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, 
however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. 
This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms.
